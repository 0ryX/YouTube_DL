# YouTube_DL

**************    YouTube_DL    ****************************

This is one of my YouTube Downloaders I've made in order to 
preserve the youtuble_dl library that can also be found at pipy.org

I haven't tested this on any other systems other then Ubuntu 20.04
The real reason I created this tool was because I recently installed 
MPD and NCMPCPP but had no music on my system to listen to. Hence this 
downloader. :D I'll be back in the future to add more here and other versions
becasue it was a lot of fun to create!!
